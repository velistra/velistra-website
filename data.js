            country: "AFGHANISTAN",
            h1: "Afghanistan’s historical stance on women’s empowerment has been shaped by prolonged conflict, regime changes, and deeply entrenched patriarchal norms. During the mid-20th century, particularly between the 1950s and 1970s, Afghanistan witnessed limited but visible state-led reforms promoting women’s education, workforce participation, and legal rights, especially in urban areas. Afghanistan acceded to the CEDAW in 2003, signaling formal alignment with international gender equality norms following the fall of the first Taliban regime. Between 2001 and 2021, the internationally recognized government committed itself to advancing women’s rights through constitutional guarantees and national action plans. However, since August 2021, the stance has drastically shifted to a systematic rollback of women’s rights.",
            h2: "The country faces severe patriarchal constraints globally. Conditioning manifests through institutionalized gender segregation, male guardianship norms, and the exclusion of women from decision-making spaces. Women are denied autonomy over education, employment, healthcare access, and freedom of movement. Critiques highlight the dismantling of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs and the implementation of bans on girls’ secondary and higher education. These policies have worsened poverty, food insecurity, and mental health crises among women.",
            h3: "Afghanistan’s negotiation limit is defined by resistance to externally imposed gender norms. It is unlikely to accept binding international commitments mandating unrestricted access to education or employment if framed without reference to cultural or religious interpretations. It will not support language explicitly condemning its governance structure or mandating enforcement mechanisms/sanctions.",
            h4: "Allies: States that emphasize cultural relativism, national sovereignty, and non-interference. Indirect alignment with conservative or traditionalist states. Rivals: Western European, North American, and Nordic countries, and states backing gender accountability mechanisms.",
            h5: "Near-total exclusion of women from secondary and higher education since 2021. Labor force participation has dropped sharply. Female-headed households face disproportionate poverty and food insecurity.",
            h6: "CEDAW (Acceded 2003), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ICESCR. Post-2021, most national gender-protective frameworks like the EVAW Law and NAPWA are suspended, unenforced, or dismantled."

            country: "ANDORRA",
            h1: "Andorra’s historical stance reflects a transition from traditional patriarchal structures to a modern rights-based framework. A decisive shift occurred with the 1993 Constitution, formally establishing equality before the law. Accession to the UN in 1993 and CEDAW in 1997 marked a commitment to dismantling patriarchal discrimination through legal and institutional reforms. It recognizes patriarchal conditioning as a structural barrier rather than an individual failing.",
            h2: "Patriarchal attitudes persist subtly within family structures and labor market segmentation. Concerns exist over gender stereotypes influencing career progression and the unequal burden of unpaid care work. A major critique concerns sexual and reproductive health rights, specifically the restrictive abortion framework, which is seen as lingering patriarchal control over women’s bodies.",
            h3: "Negotiation limits lie in maintaining national legal sovereignty over sensitive moral and constitutional issues. While supportive of principle equality, it is cautious about language mandating uniform legal standards across diverse constitutional systems or challenging entrenched norms directly.",

Post-independence state-led modernization expanded access to education and health, but progress coexisted with strong patriarchal norms. Ratified CEDAW in 1996 with initial reservations reflecting tensions with domestic family law.",
            h2: "Legal and social patriarchy remains a central barrier. While women have high educational attainment, labor force participation is low. The Family Code of 1984 is a primary focus of critique for embedding inequalities in marriage, divorce, and inheritance. Social stigma and limited survivor support hinder the implementation of anti-violence reforms.",
            h3: "Algeria seeks to protect national legal and cultural frameworks related to family law. It is unlikely to support language calling for the immediate abolition of religiously influenced family law systems. It is receptive to incremental reform language and capacity-building that respects state sovereignty.",

Ratified CEDAW in 1985 as one of the earliest in the region. Argentina frames patriarchal conditioning as a structural and cultural phenomenon requiring state accountability and legal reform.",
            h2: "Persistent patriarchal patterns remain, including high levels of femicide and domestic violence driven by machismo. Economic challenges include wage gaps and a disproportionate burden of unpaid care work. Rural and Indigenous women face compounded discrimination. Gaps exist between progressive laws and implementation due to regional disparities.",

Australia frames patriarchal conditioning as a structural issue rooted in power imbalances and stereotypes, aligning national strategies with SDG 5.",

Challenges include gender pay gaps, workforce segregation, and underrepresentation in corporate leadership. Indigenous women face intersecting inequalities and structural discrimination.",
